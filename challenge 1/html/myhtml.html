<div class="SPECIAL"> Rapper B.o.B. has caused a furore by tweeting that the Earth is in fact flat, 
and you only need to look at the evidence to come to the same conclusion. Obviously, prominent scientists 
have openly mocked this claim, showing the many ways in which it is ludicrous, no matter how many people insist 
otherwise. They’re right though; sadly. B.o.B. is wrong. His nonsense claims, such as the idea that Earth’s curvature 
should be visible at certain distances but isn’t, are just that: nonsense. His comments and insistent statements are little
 more than childish naivety. In truth, the conspiracy goes much, much deeper than that.</div>
